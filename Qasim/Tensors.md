- Tensors are similar to [[Numpy Array]], except that tensors can run on GPUs or other hardware accelerators.
- A change in the tensor reflects in the NumPy array ONLY if both are on the CPU
- - **Donâ€™t use inplace operations**
    - In-place operations save some memory, but can be problematic when computing derivatives because of an immediate loss of history. Hence, their use is discouraged.
- **By default, tensors are created on the CPU.**
    - Use .to() to move to a different device

# Syntax
- from_numpy(), numpy()
- .shape, .dtype, .device
- .item()
    - converts tensor into numerical, only for tensors with 1 element
