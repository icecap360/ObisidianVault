- Can be viewed as
    - Neural Networks with feedback
    - Neural Networks that outpput sequences
    - Neural networks that can model outputs that have patterns sequences
        - e.g. Think about cooking. Say you cook in a sequence: pie, burger, chicken. If it is sunny then you cook what you cookeed yesterday, if it is rainy you cook the next dish in the sequence. Such a situation can only be modelled by RNNs
- Can be used with varying sequences
