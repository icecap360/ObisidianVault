- - At present, three narratives are competing to be the way we understand deep learning. 
- There’s the neuroscience narrative, drawing analogies to biology. 
- There’s the representations narrative, centered on transformations of data and the manifold hypothesis. 
-  there’s a probabilistic narrative, which interprets neural networks as finding latent variables. These narratives aren’t mutually exclusive, but they do present very different ways of thinking about deep learning.
- Also there is the perspective that Deep Learning is functional programming but the functions are differentiable/optimizable [[Deep Learning as Functional Programming]]
