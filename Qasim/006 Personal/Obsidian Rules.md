## Writing Notes
* how does this relate to other notes
	* Does this note expand upon, clarify, or provide a different angle on a concept mentioned in another note?
	* are there terms that are also used in other notes
	* Is there a historical or chronological context that connects this note to other notes, or does it mark a turning point in my understanding of a topic?
* how does this fit into the bigger picture
	* what is the bigger problem that this tries to solve
* how does this relate to other relationships
	* Does this note prompt new questions or areas of inquiry that I should explore in other notes?
* Are there any contradictory viewpoints or perspectives between this note and other notes?
* What questions or gaps in my knowledge are addressed by this note, and which other notes might answer these questions or fill these gaps?

## Relationships
- Samples questions include
	- question-answer
	* topics (e.g. architecture name, learning rate, scale, vit, )
	* perspective (e.g. Bayesian, statistical)
## Primary Text
- Start the name of the note with Text, or Primary, or Paper/Blog, this will help when you search 

## Topics
* They serve as a kind of index or table of contents for many ideas/papers
* These are to be used as alternatives to tags. 
	* Tags have the benefit of being hierarchical and having counters
	* Higher order notes to maps of content are better because you can add text to a note unlike a tag
	* Notes are also easier to rename
* Examples include 
	* Authors/People
	* CV
	* ObjectDetection
	* ViT
	* NLP
	* Bayesian
	* Proof
	* Deep Learning Theory
	* Adam
	* Activation Function

## Linking Protocol
- Don't worry about linking when working with primary text should not link to anything really
	- Once you have read the primary text, then process the links into ideas. While writing ideas link to the paper, as well as other ideas
	- This way you won't create circular chains of links, and the papers kind of just remain references
	- It also helps to keep seperate your ideas from author's quotations
- Ideas should link to other ideas, to topics, and to other relationships
- Relationship notes should be written to relate ideas together

## Tags
* These should be used for status
	* Important
	* Unread - Still needs to be be read or is partially read
	* Pending - needs to be processed into 
	* Incomplete - for ideas
* They should also be used to record  included in the templates, 
## Learning Resources
* Remember to record topics to learn and Knowledge Gaps

## Advice
* Think how can I encode this knowledge better
* Stop doing things linearly
* Let the structure emerge, do not worry about folder hierarchy
* Good mindmap:
	* Hierarchy
	* Grouped - Organizing concepts and Ideas into groups
	* Reflective - how the mind processed the information
	* Interconnected - categorizing and creating more connections within the groups  
	* Non Verbal - More doodling and symbols
	* Directional - Cause & Effect
	* Emphasize - emphasizing the main concepts
* To make the most of a connection, always state explicitly why you made it. This is the link context. In short, to collect connections without an explicit intention, captured meaning, or statement of relevance is not knowledge production, and as a habit, it is even counter-productive: You make shallowness of work a habit and lower your skill as a creative knowledge worker in consequence.
* Structure notes: Structure Notes are not limited to hierarchical structures like the nested list from above. Structure notes can also have sequential structures. Imagine the following line of argumentation: a -> b -> c, therefore a -> c. A Structure Note could capture this sequence and link each step of the sequence to a Zettel which expands on it.
