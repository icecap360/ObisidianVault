- Use a transformer ontop of CNN detected features. 
	- The transformer basically looks for relationship between features
- They also want to get rid of post-processing (e.g. non-max suppression), so they use a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture
