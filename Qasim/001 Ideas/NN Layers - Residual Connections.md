-  instead of forcing the later layers to fit a desired underlying mapping, let these later layers fit a residual mapping
- “We hypothesize that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers.”
- Solve the vanishing gradient problems as well
