-_Anchor boxes_Â are a set of predefined bounding boxes of a certain height and width.
- During detection, the predefined anchor boxes are tiled across the image.
    - The network predicts the probability and other attributes, such as background, intersection over union (IoU) and offsets for every tiled anchor box.
- enables a network to detect multiple objects, objects of different scales, and overlapping objects.
- allows for parallelization
- Stride between prediction heads is a hyperparameter
